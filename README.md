# Residue Coin (RC) – Proof of Presence for the Real World

**Residue Coin (RC)** is a decentralized protocol designed to reward one of the few remaining data streams AI cannot fake: **human physical presence**.

RC is a crypto layer built on the concept of _residue_ — the digital trace left behind when a person is physically present at a real-world location or event. By verifying this presence through off-chain mechanisms, RC allows users to accumulate regionalized coins tied to their movements, engagements, and interactions across the physical world.

This repository serves as the **official archive of the RC concept**, containing the white paper, foundational mechanics, and related documentation. It is intended as a working draft to establish authorship, attract collaborators, and prepare the project for potential integration with the **Bittensor** ecosystem.

## 📄 Documents

- `rc_whitepaper.md` – The core white paper detailing RC's vision, reward structure, regional residue model, and integration possibilities.
- `faq.md` – (Coming soon) A companion document answering common questions about RC, PoP (proof of presence), and technical direction.
- `roadmap.md` – (Coming soon) An outline of development goals, launch phases, and future features.

## 🎯 Why RC?

- **Human-first crypto**: RC rewards behaviors AI can’t perform — showing up.
- **Complementary to Bittensor**: Where Bittensor captures artificial intelligence, RC captures authentic human location data as a parallel layer of value.
- **Regional identity**: RC becomes a digital passport of where someone has been — tradable, collectible, and reputational.
