# Residue Coin (RC) – FAQ (Working Draft)

---

## What is Residue Coin (RC)?
Residue Coin (RC) is a decentralized cryptocurrency that rewards **proof of physical presence**. It transforms real-world human activity into verifiable data and value. RC works as a dual-layer system:
- **Residue Layer** (non-transferable): Tracks where you've physically been over time
- **RC Token Layer** (transferable): Earned from events, business visits, and social interactions

---

## How is RC different from other cryptocurrencies?
Most cryptocurrencies rely on computational work, attention, or artificial intelligence. RC is different — it rewards something that can’t be simulated: **being somewhere in the real world**. Your presence creates value.

---

## How does RC verify that I was physically present?
RC uses a combination of:
- **GPS location tracking**
- **Time-in-place data**
- **Device and behavioral analysis**
- **Social validation (group multipliers)**
- **AI-based anomaly detection** via Bittensor subnet validators

These systems work together to verify the authenticity of your physical presence without compromising your privacy.

---

## What can I do with RC tokens?
RC tokens are transferable and can be:
- Used at participating businesses for discounts or purchases
- Redeemed for digital or real-world perks
- Traded like other cryptocurrencies
- Used to gain access to region-specific or event-based privileges

---

## What is regional residue?
Residue is the non-transferable data that passively accumulates as you spend time in a specific region. It's your **proof of being there**, tied to identity and reputation — not a tradable token. Residue helps personalize your RC footprint.

---

## Can I earn more RC by traveling?
Yes. You’ll earn residue in new regions and can get RC token boosts from participating businesses and travel-related events. However, regional residue earns **slowly and passively** to preserve its authenticity.

---

## How do businesses use RC?
Businesses can:
- Offer **RC token multipliers** to attract foot traffic
- Host **PoP-verified events**
- Accept RC tokens as payment or loyalty points
- Gain insight into local engagement and regional presence data (without user surveillance)

---

## Is RC on-chain or off-chain?
- **Residue and validation logic** are handled off-chain for privacy and performance
- **RC tokens** are issued on-chain and are fully transferable and tradable
- **Validation logic** can be hosted via a Bittensor subnet

---

## What stops people from spoofing their GPS or faking presence?
RC integrates:
- Device fingerprinting
- AI validators to detect spoof patterns
- Time/duration verification
- Optional peer validation (proximity-based)
- Reputation risk: attempting to cheat could lower your presence credibility across the network

---

## Is RC a replacement for Bittensor or TAO?
No — RC **complements** Bittensor. While Bittensor rewards intelligence and computation, RC rewards **presence and reputation**. They operate in different layers of value and can enhance each other.

---

## What blockchain is RC on?
RC is blockchain-agnostic in theory, but early implementations are planned for **Bittensor** and may use **Solana** or other performant chains for token issuance. The PoP data remains off-chain.

---

## Can RC tokens be staked?
Yes. Users can stake RC tokens to support the network and receive small, stable rewards (~3–4% APR). Staking incentives may vary by region to encourage broader adoption.

---

## Who governs the RC protocol?
- Every user has **one vote** (regardless of token amount)
- Governance is decentralized and transparent
- Disputes are handled with fixed rules and manual appeals when necessary

---

## What’s next for RC?
- Finalizing early feedback from the white paper
- Building devnet simulations of RC multipliers and validation
- Preparing a validator subnet for Bittensor
- Creating a prototype app for users and businesses
- Community onboarding and testing

---

## Who created RC?
RC was created by **Nick DuBay**, who is developing the protocol as a philosophical and economic response to the growing detachment between identity, value, and physical presence in the digital age.

This FAQ and the white paper are living documents and will evolve with feedback and collaboration.
