# ðŸª¨ Residue Coin (RC) â€” White Paper

**Residue Coin (RC)** is a decentralized proof-of-presence (PoP) protocol that uses GPS-verified, location-based data to reward real humans for being physically present in the world.

RC is designed to create meaningful economic and reputational value through time spent in specific physical locations. It bridges the physical world with a decentralized digital reward system that AI and bots cannot replicate.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of RC is to create a tokenized system that values real-world presence, incentivizes attendance at businesses or events, and enables a regionally grounded digital economy.

In a time when most online interactions can be faked or gamed, RC provides a layer of *geographically bound authenticity*.

---

## Why It Matters

- **AI-Resistant Data**: AI cannot fake GPS-based human presence.
- **Human-Centric**: Rewards real people for real-world actions.
- **Regional Identity**: Creates digital fingerprints of where people spend time.
- **Local Economies**: Businesses can reward attendance and loyalty with RC.

##  How RC Works

1. **Presence-Based Earnings**  
   Users passively earn RC by being physically present in specific regions, at a low and steady rate.

2. **Event-Based Multipliers**  
   Events or businesses can offer temporary earning boosts to encourage turnout.

3. **Residue**  
   Regional residue is a *non-tradeable proof* of time spent in a region. It accumulates slowly and acts as digital reputation or proof of belonging.

4. **RC Tokens**  
   Tradeable and transferable tokens earned through event presence or promotional attendance. These can be redeemed for discounts, perks, or other forms of value.

## Anti-Fraud Mechanisms

- Multi-factor device/location validation
- Anomaly detection using AI
- Strict verification rules for new users
- No retroactive earnings
- Transparent multiplier history

---

## Economy Design

- Fixed universal rules
- Continuous minting with a burn mechanism to control supply
- Tiered staking rewards (low but stable)
- Voting system where each wallet gets one vote regardless of holdings

## Integration with Bittensor

RC brings a valuable form of real-world, human-exclusive data to Bittensor's decentralized AI economy. RC validates human presence â€” a truth AI cannot fabricate â€” and can serve as an input or oracle for AI agents.

## Vision

RC is more than a token â€” itâ€™s an attempt to anchor digital systems in physical presence and attention. In a world dominated by AI, Residue Coin affirms the *value of being there*.
