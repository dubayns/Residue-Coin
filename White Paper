# Residue Coin (RC) White Paper – Working Draft

---

## Overview

Residue Coin (RC) is a presence-based cryptocurrency protocol built to reward and verify human activity in physical locations. It operates as a decentralized reputation and reward layer that validates proof of presence (PoP) data to mint regionally linked digital assets. RC is designed to be layered into the Bittensor ecosystem, enabling AI-based intelligence systems to gain insight from inherently human, non-replicable experiences.

RC's purpose is to recognize and value real-world engagement. Unlike most forms of digital mining or AI training, RC accrues value from something artificial intelligence cannot do: **physically exist somewhere in the world.** This makes RC uniquely positioned to complement the data economy by embedding verifiable human presence into decentralized systems.

## Core Principles

- **Proof of Presence (PoP):** RC validates and rewards location-based presence using GPS, time tracking, device telemetry, and social co-validation.
- **Residue Layer:** Presence accumulates residue over time, generating regionally bound metadata that reflects where a user has physically been. This residue cannot be traded, only accumulated.
- **Reward Token (RC):** Users earn RC tokens as a result of their presence, especially during business or event-based promotions. RC tokens are transferable and usable across regions.
- **Decentralized Identity Footprint:** A user’s RC history becomes a visible footprint of movement and interaction with the real world, forming a persistent reputational layer.
- **AI Synergy:** RC provides valuable context and training signals to AI systems by offering timestamped, geolocated, and socially verified human behavior data.

## Architecture

RC operates on a two-layered structure:

### 1. Residue Layer (Non-Transferable)
- Slow-accruing presence data tied to geographic regions  
- Represents user authenticity and commitment to physical locations  
- Serves as identity proof and reputation weight  

### 2. RC Token Layer (Transferable)
- Earned from event attendance, business visits, and social validation  
- Transferable and tradable  
- Used for perks, access, and transactions  

All earnings are subject to fixed universal rules that ensure fairness and stability.

## Bittensor Integration

RC can be implemented into the Bittensor ecosystem as a **non-competing complement** to AI intelligence mining. While Bittensor subnets reward intelligence generation and validation, RC introduces a reward stream based on the physical reality of human users.

RC reward logic will be handled **off-chain**, but **verifiable** by AI-based validators. These validators can:
- Confirm geographic plausibility  
- Analyze behavior for signs of spoofing or fraud  
- Detect signal noise from GPS, device type, and behavioral anomalies  

By using Bittensor as the substrate for validation logic, RC ensures decentralization and continual evolution of fraud detection.

---

## Use Cases

- **Event Promotion:** Businesses sponsor events with RC token multipliers to attract foot traffic  
- **Regional Loyalty:** Users earn more residue in areas where they live or stay longer, reflecting local roots  
- **Tourism & Travel:** Travelers gain residue and RC from exploring new regions, which becomes part of their identity layer  
- **Social Validation:** Group attendance boosts multiplier effects, incentivizing shared experiences  
- **Alternative Currency:** Businesses can choose to accept RC as payment, driving local economic ecosystems  

---

## Anti-Inflation & Sustainability

RC uses a **continuous mint + burn model**:
- Tokens are continuously minted via presence  
- Tokens can be burned through redemption or utility sinks (exclusive access, perks, etc.)

This keeps PoP earnings stable while controlling long-term inflation.

Staking yields remain small (3–4% APR), and vary slightly by region to incentivize adoption in underutilized areas.

---

## Governance

- One-person-one-vote system for proposed changes  
- Regional token weight does not influence governance  
- Fixed rules protect early adopters and prevent manipulation  
- Appeals and disputes are handled manually with decentralized oversight when necessary  

---

## Technical Roadmap (High-Level)

- **Phase 1:** White paper publication and idea refinement *(this stage)*  
- **Phase 2:** Devnet mockups of PoP validation and multipliers  
- **Phase 3:** Validator subnet integration on Bittensor  
- **Phase 4:** Business onramp tooling and user-facing app  
- **Phase 5:** Ecosystem growth, rewards tracking, and DAO transition  

---

## Final Thoughts

Residue Coin (RC) is a philosophical and economic response to the growing disembodiment of digital identity. In an age where intelligence can be generated, simulated, or deepfaked, **presence remains real**.

RC is designed to value that presence — not only as a currency but as proof of life, motion, and belonging.

This white paper is a living document and will evolve through feedback, participation, and iteration.
